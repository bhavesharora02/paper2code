# Generated Repo (Smoke Mode)

This folder was generated from IR + mapping.

## Files
- `model.py` — constructs model/loss/optimizer using mapping
- `data_loader.py` — tiny text/image datasets for smoke tests
- `trainer.py` — minimal training/eval loop; writes `metrics.json`
- `config.yaml` — basic config derived from IR

## Run (smoke test)
```bash
cd runs/{{ run_pkg.split('.')[-1] }}/repo
python trainer.py
```
